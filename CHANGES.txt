Changelog
=========

2.1.3 (unreleased)
------------------

- portal_type works as topic criterion without issue in event sources.
  [seanupton]

- Restrict for the presence of an operator-value in the query string to avoid
  an error on the standard event folder, where no querystring-value is given.
  [thet]

- Allow selection of initial view by request parameters.
  [rnix]

- Fixed ajax called pages with json content (Diazo compatibility).
  [fmoret]

- Fixed calendar navigation button toggle and add a transition.
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Corrected output of plone.app.event iCalendar export to avoid nesting
  VCALENDAR blocks, rather wrapping 1..* VEVENT blocks inside one VCALENDAR.
  [seanupton]

- Normalize ICS export line endings to match RFC 5545 requirements (consistent
  with what ATCT does, but using a function that could support possibly mixed
  or inconsistent line endings in source text).
  [seanupton]

- Drag-and-drop supports dexterity-based plone.app.event type
  [seanupton]

- plone.app.event Dexterity type compatibilty:
    * Conditional support overlay event display
    * iframe (quick) add form support
    * iframe edit support
    * drag-resize to change duration
    * indexer for full-day events uses IEventAccessor adapter
    * drag-and-drop support for discrete-time and all-day events.
    * Add menu support and event copy/paste compatibility.
    * Use get_uid() to support plone.uuid based UID.
  [seanupton]

- getCopyObjectsUID() identically defined in two view modules, de-duplicated.
  [seanupton]

- View adapters use UID getter (get_uid) indirection from browser.actions,
  supporting either accessor (AT) or property (dexterity) getting of
  start/end values on contexts, casting/normalizing all to DateTime
  (possibly from datetime.datetime for Dexterity-based contexts such as a
  type from plone.app.event). Added conditional adapter registration for
  plone.event.interfaces.IEvent to SolgemaFullcalendarEventDict.
  [seanupton]

- Show object actions links in view popup, provide ability to link to event
  actions in new window/tab target without being forced to use context menu.
  [seanupton]

- Fix form widget name in query string for dexterity-based plone.app.event
  type add form (minute input of each respective datetime field)
  [seanupton]

- Conditional plone.uuid / plone.app.uuid support, with backward compatibility
  fallback.  Use IUUID when available to lookup UID of item.  Added utils.py.
  [seanupton]

- When plone.app.event is both importable and installed as site product,
  display message indicating that browser adjusts events to local time.
  [seanupton]

- SFDisplayAddMenu JSON outputs first portal_type found for a Type name in
  portal_types, will be necessary for plone.app.event+Dexterity support.
  [seanupton]

- Replace search-based target folder selection widget with dependency on
  plone.formwidget.contenttree -- makes browing for a target folder more
  intuitive, also adds package and profile dependency.
  [seanupton]

- Restored compatibility with plone.app.event and recurring events.
  [thet]

- fixed bug when CriteriaItems is False
  [jensens, benniboy]

- workaround for archetypes.querywidget bug see: https://dev.plone.org/ticket/13144
